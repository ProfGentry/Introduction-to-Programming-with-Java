## Java Downloads
### Windows
- [Install the Java JDK] (https://www.java.com/en/download/)
You want to install the Java Standard Edition (SE) development kit (JDK). You can find this through Sun’s Java download site, but follow these directions for the direct link:

Go to the Java SE JDK download page.
On the left side, under Platform, select Windows.
Click the Download button.
Click the “Skip this step” link at the bottom of the dialog box that pops up.
Wait for your download to finish.
Run the installer and follow the directions. Accept the default settings.
Install Eclipse
You want the Eclipse IDE for Java developers. You can find this on the Eclipse download site, but follow these directions for the direct link:

Download the Eclipse IDE for Java Developers.
Open the zip file that you downloaded. It contains a single folder named eclipse.
Drag and drop the eclipse folder into C:\Program Files, and perhaps rename it Eclipse. You can actually put the folder anywhere, but C:\Program Files is the typical location.
Start Eclipse by double clicking on eclipse.exe.
Optional: To make it easy to find in the future, create a shortcut from eclipse.exe your Desktop, and rename it Eclipse (drag with the right mouse button to create a shortcut).

### Mac OS X
Mac OS X comes with the Java development tools. Run Software Update to ensure that you have the latest version installed (Apple Menu → Software Update).

Install Eclipse
Download the Eclipse IDE for Java Developers.
Open the archive file that you downloaded (Safari may have expanded it automatically for you).
Drag and drop the eclipse folder anywhere you want it (your Desktop may be a good place).
Run Eclipse by double clicking the Eclipse application inside the eclipse folder.

### Linux
If you are using Linux, you probably don’t need our help to get Java and Eclipse running yourself. If you do need help, ask one of the instructors during the first lecture.
