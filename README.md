# Introduction to Programming with Java
Code Repository for SDC120/L Courses

- [SDC120 Class Code](SDC120/README.md)

- [SDC120L LAB Class Code](SDC120L/README.md)

# Everyday Workflow
Your rhythm should be:
1.	Write code
2.	Save files
3.	Commit with a short message
4.	Push to GitHub
   
Do this every lab day. Small commits beat panic uploads at 11:59 PM.
