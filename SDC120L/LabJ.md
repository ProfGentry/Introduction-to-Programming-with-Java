# Lab J — Full Program Integration & Stability
## Objective
Demonstrate the ability to build a **stable, integrated Java program**.

## Activities
Students build or refactor a program that includes:
- Menu-driven control flow
- Objects and collections
- State (enum or field-based)
- Input validation
- Polymorphism (at least one overridden method)

## Requirements
- Program must run start-to-finish without crashing
- All user input must be validated
- Program behavior must remain consistent over time
- Clean exit required

## Completion Criteria
- Program survives bad input
- Objects persist correctly
- Polymorphic behavior is present
- Code is reasonably organized

## Skills Practiced

✔ Program integration

✔ Defensive programming

✔ State management

✔ Polymorphism under real conditions
