# Lab E — Methods + Collections Bootcamp

## Objective
Build confidence using methods and ArrayList together without a menu getting in the way.

## Lab Tasks
Students must create a program that:
- Defines a simple class (choose one):
  - ```Student```
  - ```Book```
  - ```Device```
- Class requirements:
  - At least 3 fields
  - A constructor
  - A ```toString()``` method
- Create an ```ArrayList``` of that class
- Write **separate methods** to:
  - Add a new object to the list
  - Display all objects
  - Count how many objects are stored
- Call all methods from ```main()```

## Constraints
- No menus required
- No user input required
- Focus is on structure, not UX

## Completion Criteria
- Program compiles and runs
- Multiple objects are stored
- Methods are clearly separated
- Output clearly shows the collection contents

## Skills Practiced

✔ Method decomposition (Ch. 6)

✔ Object instantiation

✔ ArrayList creation and iteration (Ch. 7)

✔ Passing collections to methods
