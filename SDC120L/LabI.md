# Lab I — Polymorphism in Action
## Objective
Practice implementing and observing **runtime polymorphism**.

## Activities

Students must:
- Create a base class or interface with at least one method
- Create **two or more subclasses** that override that method
- Store subclass objects in an ```ArrayList``` of the base type
- Loop through the list and call the overridden method
- Observe different outputs for each object

## Constraints
- No ```instanceof```
- No type-checking conditionals
- Behavior must be determined by overriding

## Completion Criteria
- Code compiles and runs
- Same method call behaves differently
- Output clearly shows variation

## Skills Practiced

✔ Inheritance / interfaces

✔ Method overriding

✔ Dynamic method dispatch

✔ Clean OOP design
