# Lab F — Menu-Driven Collection Manager
## Objective
Combine menus, methods, objects, and collections into a cohesive program.

## Lab Tasks
Students must build a menu-driven program that:

Menu options must include:
- Add a new item (object)
- List all items
- Search for an item by one field
- Exit

Program requirements:
- Uses an ```ArrayList``` to store objects
- Uses **methods** for each menu action
- Uses **loops** to keep menu running
- Handles invalid menu input safely

## Constraints:
- User input is required
- Program must not crash on bad input
- Logic must be broken into methods (no giant ```main()```)

## Completion Criteria
- User can add multiple objects
- Objects persist between menu actions
- Search returns correct results or a clear “not found”
- Program exits cleanly

## Skills Practiced

✔ Menu-driven control flow

✔ ArrayList searching and iteration

✔ Method parameter passing

✔ Defensive programming

✔ Program state management
