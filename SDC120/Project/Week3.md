# WEEK 3 — Collections, Search, and Structure
## Focus: Managing multiple objects correctly
## What you are building this week
Your program now behaves like a manager system, not a demo.

## Required Files to Submit
- All updated ```.java``` files
- Any new classes added this week

## Week 3 Requirements Checklist
Your program must:
- [ ] Use an ```ArrayList<BaseType>```
- [ ] Add multiple objects dynamically
- [ ] List all objects clearly
- [ ] Search for an object by one field (name, ID, index, etc.)
- [ ] Use methods for add/list/search logic
- [ ] Handle invalid input without crashing

## 🚫 Common Week 3 Mistakes
- Hardcoding objects instead of adding dynamically
- Searching by looping incorrectly
- Mixing menu logic and data logic
