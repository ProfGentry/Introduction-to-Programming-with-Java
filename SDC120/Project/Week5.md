# WEEK 5 — Polymorphism & Integration
## Focus: Extensible design and clean behavior
## What you are building this week
Your program now supports multiple types that behave differently without rewriting logic.

## Required Files to Submit
- All final ```.java``` files
- At least two subclasses
- Base class or interface

## Week 5 Requirements Checklist

Your program must:
- [ ] Define a base class or interface
- [ ] Define at least two subclasses
- [ ] Override at least one method
- [ ] Store objects as ```ArrayList<BaseType>```
- [ ] Demonstrate polymorphism (same call, different behavior)
- [ ] Avoid ```instanceof``` and type-checking conditionals
- [ ] Run start-to-finish without crashing

## 🚫 Common Week 5 Mistakes
- Large ```if/else``` blocks checking object type
- Polymorphism in name only (no overridden behavior)
- Last-minute changes that break earlier features

# 📦 FINAL SUBMISSION (End of Week 5)
You will submit:
- [ ] All ```.java``` files
- [ ] A short README explaining:
  - What the program does
  - How to run it
- [ ] Sample output showing:
  - Menu usage
  - Object creation
  - State changes
  - Polymorphic behavior

# 🧠 Important Advice
- Your program should **always work**, even if incomplete
- Each week builds on the last — do not skip checkpoints
- A simple, clean program beats a complex broken one

If you keep your project working every week, the final submission will feel straightforward—not stressful.
