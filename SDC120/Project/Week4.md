# WEEK 4 — State Management & Robustness
## Focus: Correct behavior over time
## What you are building this week
Your objects now have state, and your program enforces rules.

## Required Files to Submit
- All updated ```.java``` files
- At least one ```enum``` file (or enum inside a class)

## Week 4 Requirements Checklist

Your program must:
- [ ] Define an ```enum``` representing valid states
- [ ] Store state as part of an object
- [ ] Change state through methods
- [ ] Block invalid state transitions
- [ ] Prevent actions that don’t make sense for the current state
- [ ] Handle bad input safely using validation or ```try/catch```

## 🚫 Common Week 4 Mistakes
- Using strings instead of enums for state
- Allowing impossible state changes
- Fixing errors after they happen instead of preventing them
