# WEEK 1 — Program Startup & Menu Framework
## Focus: Program structure, clean startup, menu loop

## What you are building this week
A Java program that:
- Starts cleanly
- Displays a menu
- Loops until the user chooses Exit

No data storage yet. No objects yet. Just control flow.

## Required Files to Submit
- ```Main.java```
- ```GameEngine.java``` (or similarly named controller class)

## Requirements Checklist

Your program must: 
- [ ] Compile and run without errors
- [ ] Contain a clean  main() method
- [ ] Delegate control to another class (engine/controller)
- [ ] Display a menu with multiple options
- [ ] Loop until Exit is chosen
- [ ] Exit cleanly without crashing
- [ ] Other menu options may display placeholder messages.

## 🚫 Common Week 1 Mistakes
- Putting all logic in ```main()```
- No loop (menu runs once and quits)
- Program crashes on bad input
