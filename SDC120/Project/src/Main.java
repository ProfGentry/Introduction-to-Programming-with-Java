/*******************************************************************************************
 * Main.java
 * Programmer: 
 *
 * Entry point for the Dungeon Operation System (DOS) project.
 *
 * This class is responsible for:
 *  - Selecting ONE GameSkin implementation
 *  - Creating the GameEngine
 *  - Starting the program
 *
 * COURSE WEEK ALIGNMENT
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 * Week 1:
 *  - Basic Java program structure
 *  - Console output
 *  - Understanding the main() method
 *
 * Week 2:
 *  - Launching a menu-driven application
 *  - Delegating control to another class
 *
 * DESIGN NOTES
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 * - This file should remain small and simple.
 * - No game logic should be written here.
 * - Menu handling and gameplay belong in GameEngine.
 *
 * In real-world applications, this class acts as the
 * bootstrapper that configures and launches the system.
 *
 * If Main.java becomes large, you are likely placing
 * code in the wrong location.
