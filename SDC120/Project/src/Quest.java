 * Quest.java

 * such as its name and difficulty level. It does not contain game logic.
 *
 * COURSE WEEK ALIGNMENT
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 * Week 4:

 *  - Using classes to group related data
 *  - Passing objects between methods
 *
 * KEY RESPONSIBILITIES
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 * - Store quest-related data (name, difficulty)
 * - Provide read-only access to quest information

 * DESIGN NOTES
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 * - This class should remain simple and lightweight.
 * - Quest outcome logic belongs in GameEngine, not here.
 * - This class should not handle user input or output.
 *
 * In real-world software, this class would be considered
 * a data model or domain object.
