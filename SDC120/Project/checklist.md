## Evaluation

Your project will be graded on:
- Correct functionality
- Object-oriented design
- Exception handling
- Code quality
- Completion of required features

## Final Note

This project is designed to feel like a real system, not a toy program.

If your code is clean, readable, and stable—even if it’s simple—you’re doing it right.

Write code that you would be comfortable explaining in an interview.

That’s the goal.
