# WEEK 2 — Methods & Basic Object Creation
## Focus: Methods, objects, and storing data
## What you are building this week
Your program now creates objects and remembers them while running.

## Required Files to Submit
- Updated ```Main.java```
- Updated ```GameEngine.java```
- At least one new class (example: ```Item```, ```User```, ```Character```, etc.)

## Week 2 Requirements Checklist

Your program must:
- [ ] Define at least one class with fields and a constructor
- [ ] Create objects using ```new```
- [ ] Store objects in an ```ArrayList```
- [ ] Use methods (not giant blocks in ```main```)
- [ ] Allow the user to add objects
- [ ] Allow the user to list objects

## 🚫 Common Week 2 Mistakes
- Everything still in ```main()```
- Creating only one object (no collection)
- Printing fields directly instead of using methods
