# In-Class Activity 7 — Bug Hunting: Logic Edition

## Objective
Practice identifying logic bugs before runtime.

## Activity
Students are given a Java program that:
- Compiles
- Runs
- Appears correct
- Contains subtle logic flaws (state misuse, missing validation)

In groups, students:
- Predict failure scenarios
- Trigger bugs intentionally
- Propose fixes (pseudocode only)

## Deliverable
- List of bugs
- Explanation of how each bug occurs
