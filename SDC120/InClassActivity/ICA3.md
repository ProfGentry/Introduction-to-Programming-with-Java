# In-Class Activity 3 — Predict, Then Run
## Objective
Train students to reason about code before executing it.
## Activity
Students are given short Java programs that include:
- Nested conditionals
- Loops with exit conditions
- Method calls

Before running:
- Students predict output line by line
- Justify reasoning verbally or in writing

After running:
- Compare actual output to predictions
- Identify incorrect assumptions

## Outcome
Students learn that debugging starts in the head, not the IDE.
