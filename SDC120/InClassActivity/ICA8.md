# In-Class Activity 8 — “How Would This Scale?”
## Objective
Develop the instinct to design for change, not just correctness.

## Activity
Students are given a working Java program that:
- Uses objects
- Uses a menu
- Works correctly
- Is **not extensible** (heavy conditionals, duplicated logic)

In groups, students must:
- Identify where adding a new type would cause problems
- Propose how polymorphism would simplify the design
- Sketch:
  - A base class or interface  
  - At least two subclasses
  - Explain how the design supports future expansion

## Deliverable
- Written or diagrammed redesign
- Short explanation of benefits
