# In-Class Activity 5 — From Requirements to Design

## Objective
Practice designing a Java program before coding.

## Activity
You will be given a real-world scenario (same for everyone), such as:
```“Design a console system to manage reservations for a small business.”```

## As a group:
Identify:
- What data needs to be stored
- What actions users can take

Decide:
- What class(es) are needed
- What fields each class has

Sketch:
- Method names
- Menu options
- Data flow

No coding required initially.

## Deliverable
A written or whiteboard design showing:
- Class name
- Fields
- Method list
- Menu structure

## Why This Matters
Professionals design first. This activity surfaces whether you actually understand objects—or just type them.
