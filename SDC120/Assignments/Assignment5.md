# Assignment 5 — Managing Collections with Objects

## Type: Programming Assignment
## Objective
Design a Java program that uses objects stored in a collection and manipulates them through methods.
## Instructions
Create a program that manages a collection of items of your choice. Examples include:
- Students in a course
- Products in inventory
- Books in a library
- Devices in a lab

Your program must:
- Define a **class** to represent the item
  - At least 3 fields
  - Constructor
  - ```toString()``` method
- Use an ArrayList to store objects
- Provide methods to:
  - Add an object
  - List all objects
  - Search for an object by one field (e.g., name or ID)
- Use a menu-driven interface

## Requirements
- No code duplication
- Logic separated into methods
- No crashes on invalid input

## Submission
```.java``` file(s)

Sample output showing:
- Adding items
- Listing items
- Searching items
