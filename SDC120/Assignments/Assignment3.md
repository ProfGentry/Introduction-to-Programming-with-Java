# Assignment 3 — Decision Logic in the Real World
## Type: Programming Assignment
## Points: 100
## Objective
Use conditional logic to model real-world decisions.

## Instructions
- Create a Java class called ```Decisions``` with four methods.
- Each method must return a value (not print).

Implement logic for **any three** of the following scenarios:
- Login Lockout
  - Inputs: failedAttempts (int)
  - Output: boolean (accountLocked)
- Shipping Cost Calculator
  - Inputs: orderTotal (double)
  - Output: double (shippingCost)
- Age-Based Access
  - Inputs: age (int)
  - Output: String (“Minor”, “Adult”, “Senior”)
-  Password Strength
  - Inputs: passwordLength (int)
  - Output: String (“Weak”, “Medium”, “Strong”)

## Requirements
- Use ```if/else``` or ```switch```
- No user input required
- Methods must be called from ```main()``` for testing

## Submission
- ```Decisions.java```

✔ Practice using ```if/else```, Boolean logic, and Return values
